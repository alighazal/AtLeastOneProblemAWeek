# AtLeastOneProblemAWeek

Welcome to the **AtLeastOneProblemAWeek repository! The goal of this project is to foster consistent coding
habits by solving at least one simple problem every week in your favorite programming language. It's a fun and flexible
way to stay sharp, learn new things, and build a personal archive of solutions.
